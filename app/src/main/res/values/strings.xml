    <string name="zumba_text">
        Zumba is a popular fitness program inspired by Latin dance.
        The word "Zumba" comes from a Colombian word that means
        to move fast and have fun, which is just how people describe
        the routine. Using upbeat Latin music
        together with cardiovascular exercise, Zumba is aerobic dancing that
        is lots of fun and easy to learn. \n\n \t Zumba seems to be an optimal fitness choice,
        mixing cardio intervals with resistance training. Many experts believe that an interval/resistance
        combination maximizes caloric output, fat burning, and total body toning. Zumba mixes effective body
        sculpting movements with easy-to-follow, fun dance steps. People seem to forget about working
        out during a Zumba session, allowing them to exercise longer, and burn even more calories.
        \n\n\t A typical Zumba session lasts about an hour and incorporates several dance styles, including cumbia,
        merengue, salsa, reggaeton, mambo, rumba, flamenco, and calypso and Salsaton.The Latin music
        includes both fast and slow rhythms, allowing for a great cardio workout as well as body sculpting exercises.
        Depending on the instructor, you may even get a taste of belly dancing or hip-hop dancing, too.</string>
